Sq Framework
============

Sq is a lightweight, component based MVC PHP framework. Sq favors convention
over configuration and simplicity over architectural purity.

Sq is available under the broad BSD license making it usable in both paid and
free software.

The framework is currently in beta. Core features are largely done but I reserve
the right to change the API at any time until it's out of beta. Breaking changes
will be noted by a new release number. Full documentation coming soon.

The framework contains the following components:

- Model
- View
- Controller
- Module
- Request
- Response
- Route
- Asset
- Form
- Listing
- Auth
- Validator
- Mailer
- Slot
